# **What is Leaders scraper?**
Leaders scraper is a python program that allows you to retrieve informations from an API. These informations are about some countries and its leaders.
<br><br>

# What does it do?
Well the main thing it does is getting from each of these leaders their wikipedia pages and find the first paragraph about them and add it to the list of information that we already have to then save it in a json file named **leaders.json**.
<br><br>

## Why?
The main goal of this project was to first and **train us to code in python** but also see different tools of python such as the virtual environments and some modules that can help us make things faster and easier.<br>
Also to not just brainlessly copy/past code but to **read the documentation** and understand these tools.
